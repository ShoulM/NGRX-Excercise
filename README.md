# NGRX Excercise

This is an Angular project demonstrating the usage of [NGRX](https://ngrx.io/) for state management.
Beyond the basic [ngrx/store](https://ngrx.io/guide/store) it also uses some more advanced capabilities of NGRX such as [meta-reducers](https://ngrx.io/guide/store/metareducers), [ngrx/effects](https://ngrx.io/guide/effects) and [ngrx/entity](https://ngrx.io/guide/entity)
